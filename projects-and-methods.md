# Digital Project and Methods
The Digital Scholarship team collaborators with colleagues in the library and across campus to support new scholarly projects. We provide workshops, consultations, and in some cases, partner in the creation of projects. We also provide support for Omeka, as well as consultations on the use of other tools. We work especially wiht people trying to do Text Mining, Mapping, or in the creation of digital archives or portfolios.
